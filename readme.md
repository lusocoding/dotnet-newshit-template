# Dotnet New Sh*t Template

## Overview
This repo contains the source code for the dotnet new shit template.

It's a great example of some nonsense ideas that comes out during our team lunches.

Please don't take it serious. But use it freely!


## Installation
Clone this repo, install the template and create the project using the dotnet command line. 

For example:

``` 
C:\Repos> git clone https://github.com/lusocoding/dotnet-newshit-template.git 
C:\Repos> dotnet new -i dotnet-newshit-template\DotNet.NewShitConsoleTemplate.Csharp
c:\Repos> dotnet new shit -n MyNewShittyProject
```

## Roadmap
I think this is it. Do not expect further developments or releases... but they can happen. Who knows!?
